This is the lowest level of the application. It is responsible for
providing the minimal interface to the database. Currently, it is
only `init` and set of `searchBy*` functions. 

In the other words it is CRUD layer partially implemented with extended
READ functionality.

This layer is supposed to be used by the services layer.
